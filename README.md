Project_1.0
==========================

###Introduction

This project involves a robot with 4 motors attached that are used for controlling the track motion and 4 motors that control the flipper motion. Different modes of movements have been created which involves different combinations of all eight motors. For example, by pressing 1 on keyboard, two motors rotate in right direction and two in left. This enables various combinations. Additionally, each motor can be controlled separately by keyboard arrow keys as well. It is controlled via laptop and has a wireless range of 1.5 km (roughly 1,640 yards). It has IP cameras installed on it giving the operator live feedback from the robot. So for example, you can operate the robot to a range of 1.5km by sitting in your home. The laptop sends the signal over wireless module to a microcontroller installed on the robot with the help of a Bullet M2 wifi router. 

The code used in this repository is a shorter version of the more extensive scheme. It mostly shows different modes of motion of the robot by pressing the alphabet keys on the keyboard.
